Plack - PSGI reference implementations and utilities

## What are PSGI and Plack?

PSGI is a specification of gateway interface protocol between Perl web applications and web servers, like Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. See [PSGI specification and FAQ](http://github.com/miyagawa/psgi-specs) for details.

Plack contains reference implementations of PSGI servers and also has useful utility tools like Plackup (command line server and application launcher), Plack::Util (Useful utilities for server implementors) and Plack::Builder (DSL to quickly enable and configure Plack middleware in .psgi file).
